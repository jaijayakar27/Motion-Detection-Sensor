# Motion-Detection-Sensor
AIM:
•	The aim of the project is to show proof of concept of a motion-controlled switch that can activate a wide array of applications from small home-lights to microwave ovens.
•	For this project we aim to use easily available components to show this in action and thereby help spreading this technology’s benefits over traditional switches.

Materials Required:  
•	An LED
•	A microcontroller board such as an Arduino UNO,                        
•	A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor (HC-SR501)
•	Some connecting wires.

Connect the Arduino UNO Board to the PC using the USB connector and Use Arduino IDE to compile, Upload and Execute the program.
